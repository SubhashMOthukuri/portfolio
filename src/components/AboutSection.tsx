                I'm pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science (GPA 3.7/4.0) 
                at Concordia University Wisconsin (2023â€“2025), specializing in AI/ML, 
                Quantum Computing, and scalable software systems.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                My expertise spans developing machine learning models, quantum-secure 
                communication systems, and full-stack applications. I'm passionate about 
                innovating at the intersection of AI and Quantum to solve tomorrow's problems.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I believe in building intelligent systems that are not only powerful 
                but also secure and scalable. Whether it's deploying ML pipelines with 
                Docker or developing quantum algorithms with Qiskit, I focus on creating 
                solutions that make a real impact.
